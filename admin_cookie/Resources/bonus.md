# MD5 Hash Analysis

## What is MD5?

MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that transforms data (file, password, etc.) into a unique 128-bit digital fingerprint, typically represented by a 32-character hexadecimal string.

This fingerprint allows you to verify the integrity of the data: any modification to the original data produces a different fingerprint.

## Recognizing MD5 Hashes

We can recognize an MD5 hash by its characteristics:

- **32 characters** in length
- **Hexadecimal format** - all characters are hex (0-9 and a-f)
- That's the standard text form of a 128-bit hash, and MD5 is the most common 128-bit hash shown this way

## Testing Results

After testing, we successfully decoded `false` from the hash value.
